## REDUX, ACTIONS, REDUCERS

## What is Redux?

- Redux is a framework-agnostic library that manages global state by creating a "single source of truth" for application state. It is just a single state object that is essentially a tree. Methods are used to interact with the data in the tree. We call top level keys of this state tree "slices".
- Redux is used to maintain a large amount of data coming from a server. It is not used to manage local data originating from your client's computer. That local data would be better managed by hoisting your state. Small applications should never need Redux; a fully featured e-commerce site **might** need Redux. We teach you Redux at App Academy because you will be applying to companies large and small. Knowing the principles of state management and is vital and Redux proficiency sets you apart from other web developers.
- The latest Redux techniques use a language called TypeScript and a library called Immer which are out of the scope of App Academy. Therefore, you should not use the redux template with `create-react-app`. Re-use the Redux code provided by our projects and starters. We use Redux v4 and react-redux v7.
- The Redux setup code we give you is boilerplate and should be copied and pasted into your Redux projects. As long as you know what the functions are doing on a high level you will be fine. After you graduate go through the [docs](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#introduction) to better understand how Redux works.
- Use the Redux DevTools Extension to view your state tree in the browser. This extension will help you track actions taken with your state as well as enable you to visualize how your data flows through Redux.

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "react-redux";

// this is the top of the state tree and what you see in Redux Dev Tools
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // your database data lives here
  slice1: {
    // ...lots of data in here
  },
  slice2: {
    // ...lots of data in here
  },
  slice3: {
    // ...lots of data in here
  },
});

// the rest of redux setup is boilerplate:

// ... (middleware setup)

const configureStore = (preloadedState) => {
  return createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancer);
};

export default configureStore;
```

## Important Methods in Redux

- These core methods make the Redux store:
  - `getState()`
  - `subscribe(callback)`
  - `dispatch(action)`
- Of the three above, you will use `dispatch(action)` the most. Here's a quick look at these methods.
- `getState()` just returns the current version of your state tree. This function is mainly used by other functions. But you can invoke it anytime you want to see what your state looks like. It returns the actual state tree. You can mutate the tree but never ever do so; mutating state breaks Redux as well as React. Treat `getState()` as read only.
- `subscribe(callback)` allows you register a function to be called if the store updates. It will be put in an array that holds all the subscriptions. These subscriptions functions come from `useSelector` hooks and are how Redux informs React to rerender your components. Like `getState`, `subscribe` is mostly used by other libraries and you won't be directly calling it.
- `dispatch(action)` is the workhorse of Redux. This function is how you insert data into the store, and this function also invokes all your subscription functions when the store updates. If your reducers are built properly, your subscriptions cause your React components to rerender.
  **Put simply, calling dispatch in your React component leads to a rerender. This means that when your database changes, your website changes with it.**
- `dispatch` is your bread and butter.

Syntax:

```js
// in React's index.js
import { configureStore } from "./store";

const store = configureStore(); // store = { getState, subscribe, dispatch }
// store is the core of Redux

// insert the store into the window object to test without React
```

## React-Redux Library

- Not to be confused with Redux itself, the react-redux library is code that allows Redux to be used with React. Redux can be used by other UI libraries/frameworks like Angular and Vue so it needs these helper libraries to interface with them.
- Your interaction with `react-redux` will be with these two hooks and a provider:

- `Provider` component. <br> This is just like a provider from react context and you use it to wrap your whole application. It takes one prop, `store`, and you use it in React's index file.

```js
//react's index.js
import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from 'react-redux';

// ...

root.render(
<Provider store={store}>
<App />
</Provider>
);
```

- `useDispatch` <br> This hook calls your store's `dispatch` function behind the scenes.
