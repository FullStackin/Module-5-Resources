# GitHub README and Wiki Guidelines

## Overview (details and examples further below):

- Wiki: (separate these into their own pages)
  - API Routes (these are your backend routes)
  - Database Schema Image with Relationships
  - Features List
  - Redux State Shape
- /backend README.md
  - The README.md you made in mod 4 should now be the default README.md in the root of your /backend
- main README.md
  - Located at project root. Brief description of your site.
  - Link to live site (You want visitors to be able to easily access your site!).
  - This can eventually include images/gifs of your own site showcasing some functionality.
  - List of technologies used.
  - Instructions on how to set up the repo to run locally.
  - Note this part of documentation is usually done last. It should not be expected to look polished until mostly everything else has been done.

Does your README answer the following questions:

What is the project?
How does someone develop, use, and test the code?
How can people become more involved?
What is the licensing for this project?
How do people contact the developers or ask a question?

## Wiki:

Each project you make is expected to have thorough supporting documentation. Most of which will be in the projectâ€™s respective Wiki. This is a separate section that will have many subsections of your GitHub Repo.

(Note: a Frontend Routes section is not required for mod 5 but would be ideal in the long run)

Feature List Section Example:
Note, some detail should be included but it does not have to be as detailed as user stories.

## Redux State Shape Section Example:

## main README EXAMPLES:

Note, this part of your documentation should be done last. We do not expect it to look polished until much later stages of development.
