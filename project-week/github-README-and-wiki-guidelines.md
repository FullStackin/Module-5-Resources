# GitHub README and Wiki Guidelines

Every great project needs great documentation, including a README and a Wiki.
The goals of documentation are to answer the following questions:

1. What is your project, what does it do, and how was it designed?
2. How can someone run, develop and use your code?
3. How can you be contacted or asked a question?

## Overview and Checklist of Requirements:

- `/` **README.md**
  - Located at project root (`/`).
  - Link to live site.
  - Brief description of your site.
  - List of technologies used.
  - Usage descriptions of features.
    - Images and/or GIFs of your own site showcasing and additional insight
      some functionality.
  - Road map or to do list for future features.
  - Get started section with instructions on how to set up the repo to run the
    project locally.
  - Contact information.
- `/backend` **README.md**
  - The **README.md** you made in Mod 4 should now be the default **README.md**
    in the root of your /backend
    - You do not need to edit this file further after moving it.
- **Wiki**
  - Separate each of these into their own pages on the Wiki.
    - API routes.
      - List the documentation you have from mod 4.
    - Database schema image with relationships.
    - Features list.
      - Include descriptions and some details. This does not need to be as
        detailed as user stories
    - Redux state shape.

## README EXAMPLES:

Note, this part of your documentation should be done last. We do not expect it to look polished until much later stages of development.

## Wiki:

Each project you make is expected to have thorough supporting documentation. Most of which will be in the projectâ€™s respective Wiki. This is a separate section that will have many subsections of your GitHub Repo.

(Note: a Frontend Routes section is not required for mod 5 but would be ideal in the long run)

Feature List Section Example:
Note, some detail should be included but it does not have to be as detailed as user stories.

## Redux State Shape Section Example:
